# Drug-target interaction prediction using multi-target prediction methods 

## Basic information

This is a repository that includes all the scripts and data that I used for my master thesis. The script of setting B and C are combined together because the methods are basically the same, only need to change the training dataset.

## Dataset

A golden standard dataset is used as training and test dataset, which can be downloaded from the paper [Pliakos K, Vens C. Network inference with ensembles of bi-clustering trees[J]. BMC bioinformatics, 2019, 20(1): 1-12.](https://people.montefiore.uliege.be/schrynemackers/datasets). We choose E.coli-regulator network (ERN), S.cerevisiae regulatory network (SRN), drug-protein interaction network (DPI) datasets because the size of it is more suitable in our case.
